8.13 You have a stack of n boxes, with widths w, heights h and depths d. The boxes cannot
be rotated and can only be stack on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly
larger than the box above it in width, height and depth. Implement a method to compute the
height of the tallest possible stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of
each box.
